  n 차 방정식?
  
    If n is 1, you solve LinearEquation.
    ax + b = 0

        If 부정 방정식 (x == 모든 수) is meaning (your x value) is all number.
        Else if 불능 방정식 (x == null) is meaning (your x value) is none.
        Else if x == (your x value)
                (your a value) X (your x value) == (your b value) is your equation.
      
    else if n is 2, you solve QuadraticEquation.
    ax^2 + bx + c = 0
